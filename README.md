# CSE327.8_Project_Group_3
Project for CSE327 Section 8, Group 3, Summer 2023


Please keep everything inside a parent folder named shop3. This is because, during development, shop3 was used as a parent folder in the components folder php files, and absolute referencing was included with /shop3 as root. You can change all mentions of shop3 within the components folder with your preferred parent folder name.

In other files apart from components, relative referencing was used.
